Tic Tac Toe
  this website consists of javaScript that enables the user to play with a computer and inputs a line along with sounds indicating the game was won, also resets after game is over
  with the next move inputed. Truly had fun with this one!
	
Movie theatre | Bootstrap
	For me this website was cool and exciting to make because it felt like something I've actually seen before! The menu displays The different layouts used for this webpage was awesome 
  to learn. Here we added JavaScript to the menu giving us the option of input data for the rewards deals, also implemented pop ups as well!
